# Building from source
You need conda, but then it's as easy as running `build.bat` on windows. Linux is slightly different. \
You can refer to the [docker version](https://github.com/MagicBOTAlex/DockeredMLEyeTrack).

# Licensing
This project unfortunately is under Project Babble's restrictive license because of their MJPG Streamer. \
If somebody could make a replacement, then please do. If not, then this project will remain under their control/license.
